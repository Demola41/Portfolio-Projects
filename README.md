# Sales Performance Analysis
## Situation
Analyzed seven years of sales data (2014–2021) for a global retailer with $2.91 billion in revenue across six countries to evaluate long-term market trends.
The goal was to assess performance across 2,412 products and 14 manufacturers to identify key growth drivers and regional opportunities.
Used Power BI to build a comprehensive dashboard featuring time-series revenue tracking and geospatial analysis. I segmented data by urban vs. rural markets and manufacturer performance.
The project highlighted a 187.73% total revenue increase and identified the USA ($1.70bn) and Urban markets (79.79% of sales) as the primary revenue engines.
Recommended establishing distribution centers in urban USA regions to support the 80% demand volume and discontinuing low-performing rural logistics routes to improve margin efficiency.
